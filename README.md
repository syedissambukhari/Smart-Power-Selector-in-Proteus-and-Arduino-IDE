## Introduction

The Smart Power Selector is designed to automatically switch between different power sources to maintain uninterrupted power supply. It monitors voltage and current readings and displays them on an LCD, while prioritizing solar power, grid power (WAPDA), and generators.

## Features

- **Automatic Power Source Selection:** Automatically switches to the most efficient power source based on availability and priority.
- **LCD Display:** Shows real-time voltage and current readings for each power source.
- **Proteus Simulation:** Provides a simulation environment for testing and debugging.
- **Arduino Code:** Implements the logic for the smart power selector in the Arduino IDE.

## Technologies Used

- Proteus
- Arduino IDE
- C/C++ (for Arduino)
- LCD Display
- Relays
- Voltage and Current Sensors

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/syedissambukhari/Smart-Power-Selector-in-Proteus-and-Arduino-IDE.git
    ```

2. **Open the project in Proteus:**

    - Navigate to the `Proteus` directory and open the `.pdsprj` file.

3. **Open the Arduino Code:**

    - Navigate to the `Arduino` directory and open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.

## Usage

1. **Proteus Simulation:**

    - Run the simulation in Proteus to test the smart power selector circuit.
    - Observe the automatic switching of power sources based on the simulated conditions.

2. **Arduino Code:**

    - Upload the Arduino code to your microcontroller.
    - Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram.
    - Monitor the LCD display for real-time voltage and current readings.
